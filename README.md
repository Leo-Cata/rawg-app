This project utilizes [RAWG](https://rawg.io/)'s API services, offering a vast video game database, along with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)'s Google Authentication and Firestore database, and [Ultima API](https://www.ultima.rest/) for game quotes.

This fully responsive site allows users to explore games based on decades, genres, platforms, Metacritic scores, and more. Users can access short descriptions, learn about genres, tags, release dates, view game screenshots, and more. Additionally, the site integrates Google authentication and Firestore, enabling users to add games to a backlog for later play, with the list accessible in their private profile.

The primary focus of this project is to continuously enhance my front-end skills, incorporating new technologies like Firebase services and Swiper.js, while reinforcing proficiency in previously utilized tools and libraries.

The project is hosted on Netlify and can be viewed at: [Backlogged](https://backlogged.netlify.app)
